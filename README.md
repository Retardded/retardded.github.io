my folio.

this repo now also contains:

- `react-portfolio` — the same page rebuilt with **Vite + React + TypeScript**
- `vue-portfolio` — the same page rebuilt with **Vite + Vue 3 + TypeScript**

to run locally:

- **react version**
  - `cd react-portfolio`
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev`

- **vue version**
  - `cd vue-portfolio`
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev`

note: both apps expect the screenshots to be available at `/images/...`.
you can copy the existing `images` folder into each app’s `public` dir
if you want the sliders to use the real assets in dev.
